SARE - Simple API for Regular Expressions
=========================================

SARE stands for Simple API for Regular Expressions. Its an extension API that provides event based regular expression parsing. SARE's API is very simple. The developer need only to implement an interface, action event handler and attach it to the specific group of SARE parser.

Current Version is 1.0. So feel free to download, experiment with the source and send me any comments. 

**Note for Developers ( if anyone exists :) ) - SARE will change substantialy in the following months**
